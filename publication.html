    <p>Subsequence clustering of multivariate time series is a useful toolfor discovering repeated patterns in temporal data. Once these pat-terns have been discovered, seemingly complicated datasets can beinterpreted as a temporal sequence of only a small number of states,orclusters. For example, raw sensor data from a fitness-trackingapplication can be expressed as a timeline of a select few actions(i.e., walking, sitting, running). ...</p>

    <p>The Internet-of-Things paradigm has brought exciting opportunities to increase productivity and efficiency but also to enhance customer experience. Such things are expected to connect and exchange information enabling applications to propose a value added services. However, due to their heterogeneous nature, things communicate in different semantics making integration a laborious and costly to achieve. ...</p>
