<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This project proposes to investigate the impact of the use of autonomous social agents to optimise manufacturing process in the framework of Industry 4.0. "Social" means that cyberphysical entities will act autonomously in order to optimize an industrial process following behaviour models inspired by human social networks. Currently, in Industry 4.0, smart entities do exist. However, intelligence is localised and intelligent heterogeneous entities cannot communicate together even inside the same shop-floor. Our motivation comes from the observation that, if we want to create a real Internet of Everything that brings together processes, data, things, and people, all these entities have to be connected and follow a shared, easy to understand paradigm.</p>


<h2>Project</h2>

<p>In this project, we propose a holistic multi-agent paradigm that encompasses machines and humans. The presence of human operators is therefore crucial both to teach to and to learn from software agents, via deep learning and data mining algorithms. Agents will take decisions merging and analysing big and heterogeneous data produced by sensors (vibration, temperature, etc.), automation and information systems (such as enterprise resource planning and manufacturing execution system), and humans in real-time.</p>

<h2>Workplan</h2>

<p>The project is organized in 7 work packages (WP) designed to achieve the research objectives. Every work package is further divided into individual tasks (T) as detailed in the following sections. Tasks are proposed in a way to guarantee the fulfilment of work package deliverables. The relation among the work packages is presented below. There is considerable collaboration and interaction between all work packages with the objective to propose and implement a coherent solution. In addition, the connections among the work packages involves a real collaboration among all partners in the project.</p>
